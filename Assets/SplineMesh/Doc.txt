// What is it?
    A spline is a set of nodes connected by bezier curves. Each node is defined by a position, a direction, and if set as a corner node, a second direction.
	The MeshBender component create a mesh from a source mesh by moving its vertices accordingly to a bezier curve.

// How to create a spline object?
    Menu -> GameObject -> 3D Object -> Spline
     - or -
	on any object, add the component Spline

// How to draw a spline?
    select an object with Spline component (and make sure the component is opened)
	a basic 2-nodes spline is created by default
	select a node and move it
	when a node is selected, the directions appear. Select one of them and move it
	hold alt key and drag a node to duplicate it
	use delete button in the inspector to delete selected node (you can't have less than two nodes)

// How to draw a corner?
    select an object with Spline component (and make sure the component is opened)
	change the Handle type to Corner
	when a node is selected, the two directions can be moved separately.

// How to bend a mesh?
    you will probably need a script to create the GameObjects holding curved meshes
	every usecase is unique and you will have to create your own script to suit you specific needs
	Don't worry, it's easy : explore exemple scripts in the showcase scene to see what you can do and how

// What else can I do?
    anything that is curved, from road to tentacle to footprint track to bat trajectory to...


Troubleshooting :
 - My bended mesh is not smooth
Your mesh probably lack vertices along the axis to bend : SplineMesh doesn't add vertices to the mesh, it only move existing ones.
Try adding vertices on the mesh along the axis to bend
Try to have more smaller curves on your spline

 - My mesh seems broken
The MeshBender only bend along X axis. Your mesh is probably not oriented this way. You can specify a rotation (see ExemplePipe)

 - Mesh or extrusion generation is slow in the editor
More vertices means less performances. Try to reduce the vertex count.
Very long splines can lead to performance issues too. Try many splines with less nodes.
