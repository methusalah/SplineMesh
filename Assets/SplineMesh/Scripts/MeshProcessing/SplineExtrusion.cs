    /// drawing only the 2D shape to extrude along the spline. The result is not intended to be used in a production context and you will most likely
    /// create eventualy the mesh you need in a modeling tool to save performances and have better control.
    /// 
    /// The special editor of this component allow you to draw a 2D shape with vertices, normals and U texture coordinate. The V coordinate is set
    /// for the whole spline, by setting the number of times the texture must be repeated.
    /// 
    /// All faces of the resulting mesh are smoothed. If you want to obtain an edge without smoothing, you will have to overlap two vertices and set two normals.
    /// 
    /// You can expand the vertices list in the inspector to access data and enter precise values.
    /// 
    /// This component doesn't offer much control as Unity is not a modeling tool. That said, you should be able to create your own version easily.
